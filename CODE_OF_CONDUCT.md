# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in mind-android and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, or religion.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive,
and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers (including Andrew Jones)
are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behaviour
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing mind-android in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing,
or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting Andrew Jones at princeajsa@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated
to respect the privacy and security of the person reporting an incident.
